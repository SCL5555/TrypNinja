##Description
TrypNinja is an application which allows the user to create a story from a mobile device. Once logged into the application, the user can either return to a story previously started or begin a new story. The user is offered the option to enter a text item or a photo. When the user selects to add a photo, the application will call up the camera, the user snaps a photo, and the application adds the photo to the story.
 
##The Need Our App Fills
TrypNinja fills the gap in existing social media sites by allowing users to create a COMPLETE story and publishing it for others to see.  Stories are comprised photos and text.
